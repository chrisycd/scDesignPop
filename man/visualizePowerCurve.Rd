\usage{
visualizePowerCurve(
  power_result,
  celltype_vector,
  x_axis = "nindiv",
  x_facet = "celltype",
  y_facet = "ncell",
  col_group = "method",
  geneid,
  snpid
)
}
\arguments{
\item{power_result}{A data frame containing the power analysis results under
different design parameter settings. It is expected to include columns
such as \code{celltype}, \code{nindiv}, \code{ncell}, \code{method},
and summary statistics such as \code{mean}, \code{sd}, \code{power},
\code{slope}, and/or \code{specifiedES}, depending on the chosen
\code{x_axis}, \code{x_facet}, \code{y_facet}, and \code{col_group}
arguments.}

\item{celltype_vector}{A character vector specifying the cell types to be
included in the visualization. When \code{x_axis != "specifiedES"}, curves
for all selected cell types are shown. When \code{x_axis == "specifiedES"},
only the first cell type in \code{celltype_vector} is used.}

\item{x_axis}{A character string specifying which variable in
\code{power_result} is mapped to the x-axis. Supported values are
\code{"nindiv"} (number of individuals), \code{"ncell"} (number of cells
per individual), and \code{"specifiedES"} (specified effect sizes). The
default is \code{"nindiv"}.}

\item{x_facet}{A character string specifying the variable used to define
columns in the facet grid. Typical choices are \code{"celltype"},
\code{"nindiv"}, or \code{"ncell"}, and only specific combinations with
\code{x_axis} and \code{y_facet} are supported (see function code for
details). The default is \code{"celltype"}.}

\item{y_facet}{A character string specifying the variable used to define
rows in the facet grid. Typical choices are \code{"ncell"} or
\code{"nindiv"}, and only specific combinations with \code{x_axis} and
\code{x_facet} are supported. The default is \code{"ncell"}.}

\item{col_group}{A character string specifying the variable in
\code{power_result} that defines the color (and shape) groups for the
curves. This is typically the eQTL model or analysis method, and defaults
to \code{"method"}.}

\item{geneid}{A character string giving the gene identifier to be included
in the main plot title.}

\item{snpid}{A character string giving the SNP identifier to be included
in the main plot title (together with \code{geneid}).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the power curves under the
specified design settings
}
\description{
Create faceted power curves summarizing how power changes across different
study design settings (e.g., numbers of individuals, numbers of cells per
individual, or specified effect sizes), stratified by cell type and eQTL
model.
}
\details{
When \code{x_axis != "specifiedES"}, power is plotted against either the
number of individuals or the number of cells per individual, with facets
arranged by the remaining design variable and cell type. When
\code{x_axis == "specifiedES"}, power is plotted as a function of specified
effect sizes for a single cell type (the first element of
\code{celltype_vector}), with facets arranged by the design parameters.
In all cases, a horizontal dashed line at power = 0.8 is added to indicate
a commonly used target threshold.
