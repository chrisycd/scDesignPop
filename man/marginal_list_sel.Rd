\title{Example list of scDesignPop's marginal models}
\format{
A named list. Each element corresponds to one gene (e.g.,
\code{"ENSG00000163221"}, \code{"ENSG00000135218"}) and is a list with
the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{fit}}{A fitted generalized linear mixed model, typically
a negative binomial mixed model (e.g., from \pkg{glmmTMB}) with
random intercepts for individuals and fixed effects for cell type,
SNP genotype, and SNP–cell-type interactions.}
\item{\code{time}}{Computation time (in seconds) required to fit the model.}
\item{\code{snp_cov}}{Character string giving the SNP covariate used in
the model (e.g., \code{"1:153337943"}).}
\item{\code{model_attr}}{A list of auxiliary model attributes, including
the \code{terms} object, variable names, and data classes used for
constructing the model matrix.}
\item{\code{removed_cell}}{Information about removed cells (if any)
during model fitting; \code{NA} if no cells were removed.}
}

\usage{
data("marginal_list_sel")
}
\description{
A named list of fitted marginal models for selected gene–SNP
pairs used in the examples of scDesignPop. Each element corresponds to one
gene and contains the fitted model object, the SNP used as covariate, and
additional model attributes.
}
\details{
This dataset is useful for demonstrating how to directly perform power
analysis using the fitted marginal models of the scDesignPop.
