# scDesignPop

------------------------------------------------------------------------

scDesignPop is a simulator for population-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. By incorporating eQTL effects from genotype data with other covariates, scDesignPop has several key applications: 

- 1) performing eQTL power analyses at cell-type resolution, 

- 2) protecting genomic privacy by mitigating eQTL-based re-identification of individuals via linking attacks, 

- 3) simulating scRNA-seq data for new individuals using either simulated or real genotype data, and 

- 4) generating positive- and negative-control data for cell-type-specific eQTLs.
